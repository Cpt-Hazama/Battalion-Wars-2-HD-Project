An HD overhaul of BW2 that comes with 1K/2K/4K sprites, diffuse, bump, and specular maps that will truly bring Battalion Wars 2 to life on the PC. This is a texture resource for Dolphin Emulator, meaning it's entirely client-side and is completely fine to use in multiplayer

## Installation
- Use the GitHub Desktop app to install this!
- The directory in which it should save the files should be 'C:\Users\YOUR_OS_USERNAME\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\RBWE01\'
- Make sure your Dolphin is configured to load custom textures, you'll know if it installed correctly if the Battalion Wars logo on the home screen is new

So, it should look like this:
